description: "The Ghost Pirates is a novel by William Hope Hodgson, first published\
  \ in 1909. The economic style of writing has led horror writer Robert Weinberg to\
  \ describe The Ghost Pirates as \"one of the finest examples of the tightly written\
  \ novel ever published.\"\nIn it, Hodgson never describes in any remarkable details\
  \ the ghosts - if this is indeed what they are, since their true nature is left\
  \ ambiguous - he merely reports on their gradual commandeering of the ship.\n\"\
  The Ghost Pirates . . . is a powerful account of a doomed and haunted ship on its\
  \ last voyage, and of the terrible sea-devils (of quasi-human aspect, and perhaps\
  \ the spirits of bygone buccaneers) that besiege it and finally drag it down to\
  \ an unknown fate. With its command of maritime knowledge, and its clever selection\
  \ of hints and incidents suggestive of latent horrors in nature, this book at times\
  \ reaches enviable peaks of power.\" â€” H.P. Lovecraft\nThe novel is presented as\
  \ the transcribed testimony of Jessop, who we ultimately discover is the only survivor\
  \ of the final voyage of the Mortzestus, having been rescued from drowning by the\
  \ crew of the passing Sangier. It begins with Jessop's recounting how he came to\
  \ be aboard the ill-fated Mortzestus and the rumors surrounding the vessel. Jessop\
  \ then begins to recount the unusual events that rapidly increase in both frequency\
  \ and severity. In the telling of his tale, Jessop offers only sparse interpretation\
  \ of the events, spending most of the time relating the story in an almost journalistic\
  \ fashion, presenting a relatively unvarnished description of the events and conversations\
  \ as they occurred. He describes his confusion and uncertainty about what he believes\
  \ he has seen, at times fearing for his own sanity. He eventually hears other members\
  \ of the crew speak of strange events, most of which the rest of the crew pass off\
  \ as either bad luck or the result of the witness being either tired or \"dotty\"\
  . Jessop only offers brief personal interpretation; he states that while he cannot\
  \ discount the idea that the beings plaguing the ship may be ghosts, he presents\
  \ his theory that they may be beings from another dimension that, while sharing\
  \ the same physical space as theirs, are normally completely separated to the extent\
  \ that neither dimension is aware of the existence of the other. He offers only\
  \ vague, superficial suggestions as to the cause of his theorized dimensional breach.\n\
  The seafaring jargon, coupled with the phonetically rendered dialects of some of\
  \ the crew, make the text at times somewhat opaque, while at the same time lending\
  \ it an air of authenticity and believability. Through the use of compactly written\
  \ prose and simple, almost offhand foreshadowing, Hodgson gradually increases the\
  \ suspense and sense of dread. Added to this is the fact that the beings invading\
  \ the ship are neither described in any detail nor explained as to their origin\
  \ or motive. The combination of these literary devices allows Hodgson to amplify\
  \ the feeling of impending doom until the moment of the novel's unavoidable climax,\
  \ when the \"sea-devils\", as Lovecraft describes them, pull the Mortzestus beneath\
  \ the waves.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
